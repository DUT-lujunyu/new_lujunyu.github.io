Welcome! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Hongfei Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=kV68br0AAAAJ) at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, China. I'm also a member of [Information Retrieval Laboratory (DUTIR)](http://ir.dlut.edu.cn). I like reading novels and watching movies.
